description,"Humans have evolved from the latent memories ancestral past which explains similar modes of functioning patterns of behaviour that occurs across the globe. This understanding of human personality always fascinates me. As a student of Art College I was drawn into painting masks, Fathoming various complexities of human mind in diverse and challenging situations. My drawings were a narrative of innumerable shades of personality, from dark, mysterious, sensuous, scary to happy, joyful, compassionate, serene to a diverse spectrum. <br/> A midst of all the events, becoming a mother was a very special life event. I was reborn with the birth of my children. I experienced the power of creating that mother nature has bestowed. Flowers did the magic Flowers did the magic of bridging the gap between the feelings of power and un-masked emotions – strength and vulnerability. They helped me cover and uncover the emotions and speak my heart bigger."
